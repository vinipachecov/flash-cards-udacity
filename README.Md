This is the last project for the Udacity React Nanodegree course(at least in my attempt). The project is a flash cards app that have decks of questions and answers to help users keep some topic or knowledge fresh in their memory.

## Observations
I did use two projects because In my setup using expo was not a good idea for the overall development, so I setup a native project with react-native-cli (i.e react init name_project) and did all through this other project. In the end as I thought it would be better to use Expo Notifications API and then I decided to merge the files to the expo project once again.

## Running
You will need expo cli installed in your computer if you intend to 
run this project.

Open an android or ios emulator with in your computer.

-- Hint

For android you can check your emulators available by checking your AVD Manager in
Android Studio or by typing:
```
emulator --list-avds
```

Go to the project folder in your cli terminal and enter the command:

```
expo start
```
